Dear ravettel, Hello.

I hope that I got to the right person, assuming you are 'krabbencutter' from the GroupDIY forum.

In case you are:

In febuary 2020 you posted about an attempt to creating a waves SoundGrid server.
You mentioned a .config file that has to be copied from a running SG server. I wonder if you could send me the file in question, for I have no access to SG servers.
I cannot register for the GroupDIY forum because the admins does not verify emails anymore :(
This is why I'm trying to contact you through this readme file.

Thank you,
Xhuui
